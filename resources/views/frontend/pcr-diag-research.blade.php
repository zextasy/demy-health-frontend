                            <li>Greatly impacted the molecular diagnostic space in Nigeria by significantly increasing the affordability of high-end quality molecular tests.</li>
                            <li>Contributed to the body of knowledge in the infectious disease sub-specialization by closing the country’s Hepatitis C genotype testing gap. We were the first molecular lab in Nigeria to identify mixed Hepatitis C virus infections involving 3 sero-groups in the national population—an uncommon feat. This earned us a double slot to present our findings at the Nigerian Gastroenterology and Hepatology Conference in August 2018.</li>
                            <li>Set up over 40 fully functional biosafety level 2 and level 3 molecular laboratories in Nigeria.</li><li>Sold and installed 50 PCR machines, 30 automated nucleic acid extractors and many other biotechnology solutions in Nigeria since 2018. We have also sold several millions of molecular diagnostic test kits, research test kits and consumables.</li>
